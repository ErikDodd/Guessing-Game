                <h2>Goals & Vision for the Future</h2>
                <p>My main goal is become a Front-end Developer or Full-Stack Developer. I enjoy problem-solving, technology, learning and building things, so a Software Development
                    is at the core of my vision for the future. I plan to be able to work remotely, lead a team of developers, and even potentially start my own business in the future. 
                    My long-term goal would be to live and travel in Europe/Around the World while working.
